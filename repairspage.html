<h3>REPAIRS DETAILS</h3>

<p>
Repairs will be carried out on a property depending on the type of repair, the degree of urgency and if the tenant has paid their rent up to date and is a registered tenant.
The tenants in a South Dublin County Council homes are responsible for repairs of a non-structural nature. 
When an employee is deciding if a repair should be carried out, the above points should be taken into consideration. 
If an employee decides that the repair will be carried out on a property then the repair details should be added to the database.
It is important that a date and time is selected to carry out the work.
It is also important that the degree of urgency is stated as this will determine how long it will take to respond to the job needed to be carried out.
