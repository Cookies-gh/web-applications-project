<h3>MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS SECTION</h3>
<p>
South Dublin Housing Council is a large housing authority which operates a number of corporation housing estates and flat blocks in South Dublin. 
If a tenant's property is in need of repair the tenant can send in a request for repair either by telephone or in writing by letter or email. 
If the tenant is registered with South Dublin County Council they may be eligible for repairs on their property depending on the type of repair needed and the degree of urgency of the repair.
If a tenant is approved for a repair on their property a tradesman is sent to their property to carry out the repair. The equipment used by the tradesman is supplied by South Dublin Housing Council and is stored in our equipment workshop.
