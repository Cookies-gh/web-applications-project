<h3>EQUIPMENT DETAILS</h3>

<p>
It is important that employees for South Dublin Housing Council have the right equipment to carry out repairs on our properties and that equipment is in excellent repair.
If the right equipment is available to our employees this insures that the repairs job is carried out to the highest standard. 
When you use equipment it is important to check it's state of repair to insure that it is fit for it's intended purpose and that it can be replaced if needs be. 
If new equipment has been purchased for a repairs job it should be entered into the database so that the procurement section in South Dublin Housing Council can have a record of all of our equipment and monitor the state of repair of it's equipment.
